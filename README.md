NLP Resume Screening System

This project builds an end-to-end NLP-based resume screening system that automatically classifies resumes into predefined job categories using machine learning.

The goal is to demonstrate how natural language processing can be applied to automate and improve initial resume shortlisting in recruitment workflows.

Project Overview

Performed exploratory data analysis on resume data

Cleaned and preprocessed raw resume text

Balanced imbalanced job categories using oversampling

Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF

Trained and compared multiple ML models

Built a prediction pipeline to classify new resumes

Models Used

K-Nearest Neighbors

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (Best Performing)

SVM achieved the highest accuracy due to its effectiveness with high-dimensional and sparse text data.

Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

NLP (TF-IDF)

Key Outcome

The final system successfully predicts the job category of unseen resumes, showcasing a practical NLP application for resume screening and recruitment automation.
